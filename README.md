# Protective Visor Headband

## Modification of Prusa covid19 visor headband to use elastic strap without button holes

contains
- [original](covid19_headband_rc2.stl) Prusa RC2 STL model
- [modified](covid19_headband_rc2_bpm02.stl) Prusa RC2 STL model replacing strap attachment with cinch design to allow use of flat web strap without holes (using strap width of 3/4" or 20mm)
- OpenSCAD [code](covid19_headband_rc2_bpm03.scad) used to generate modified STL model (easy change to different designed strap width)
- PDF of [cut template](PrusaFaceShieldHoles.pdf) for positioning holes in shield (using primarily overhead transparency sheets 8 1/2" by 11")

Tip:  After attaching shield, placing rubberbands between each pair of left and right side posts adds an extra layer of robustness to the shield attachment.
