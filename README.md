## Modification of Prusa covid19 visor headband to use elastic strap without button holes

contains
- [original](covid19_headband_rc2.stl) Prusa RC2 STL model (downloaded Mar 22, 2020)
- [modified](covid19_headband_rc2_bpm02.stl) Prusa RC2 STL model replacing strap attachment with cinch design to allow use of flat web strap without holes (using strap width of 3/4" or 20mm).  Import this STL into your printer's slicer to generate your machine's gcode.  Recommended material is PETG.
- OpenSCAD [code](covid19_headband_rc2_bpm03.scad) used to generate modified STL model (easy change to different designed strap width)
- PDF of [cut template](PrusaFaceShieldHolesRC2.pdf) for positioning holes in shield (using primarily overhead transparency sheets 8 1/2" by 11")

Tip:  See threading [instructions](LoopThread/ThreadInstructions.md) to attach elastic band.  The elastic band should be approximately 18" (38 mm).

A fast, low cost way to make face shields is using overhead transparency sheets.  It just requires a hole punch and a printed [cut template](PrusaFaceShieldHolesRC2.pdf).  The sheet is attached by slipping its holes over the posts on the headband.  These sheets can be easily discarded and replaced with new ones for cleanliness.  The headband can be quickly sterilized for reuse.  Alternatively, lamination sheets have been reported to be used as shields but I haven't tried.

Tip:  Clip your printed [cut template](PrusaFaceShieldHolesRC2.pdf) to your transparency before punching holes to maintain proper hole alignment.

Thanks Josef Prusa for your open support.  Original model was obtained [here](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-prusa-protective-face-shield-rc1).  Their [link](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-prusa-protective-face-shield-rc1) provides good documentation of the design and use.  The modifications here were made to support rapid local use.
